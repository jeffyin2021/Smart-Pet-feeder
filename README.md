## Usage scenarios
<br>
* FEEDING WITH SMARTPHONE: <br>
To make the feeding much easier, we abandon the clumsy control panel on feeder and complex wifi connection. We connect the feeder and the App on your smartphone via Bluetooth and WIFI, which is much easier and faster. you can schedule meals in the  app 
<br>
* PERSONALIZED VOICE PROMPT: <br>
The pet feeder support 10 seconds voice recording and playback. You can record your own voice such as ‘Baby, it’s time for lunch’, ‘Come and eat, boy’, then it will play automatically at mealtimes, to remind your pets to eat. If you don’t need the recording, you can easily cancel it 
<br>
* FLEXIBLE PORTION SIZE: <br>
The food storage capacity is 4L (16 cups) for dry food, your pet can stay well-fed for many days between refills. It provides flexible portions from 1 to 20 portions per meal, about 5g (0.18 oz) for each portion. You can schedule up to 8 meals a day and customize the portion size for each automatic feeding, to fit your pet's needs and make your pet healthier
<br>

It supports both AC power and battery power. In case of power outage, the pet feeder will run on 3 D-cell alkaline batteries (not included) to assure your pet never miss a feeding.
